month: November
subheader: International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women (November 25)
description: Violence against women is defined by the UN General Assembly's Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life." This violation of our human rights affects women of all ethnicities, races, sexualities, economic classes, ages, and living situations. Stand in solidarity with all women by keeping updated with activism groups near you and becoming more aware of the challenges being faced by your local mothers, sisters, and friends.
