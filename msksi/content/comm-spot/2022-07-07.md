# Second Annual Tea and Chat Event

Girls gathered at the Hilton Garden Innâ€™s Tea House Garden May 25, 2023, as one female-led and -driven group! As they enjoyed delicious finger foods and performances by different school-based groups, like the Afro Alliance Students for Curtis High School, women here talked about the projects in the air for female empowerment. Join us next year!
